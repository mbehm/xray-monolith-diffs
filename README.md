# Filtered Diffs for changes in XRay Monolith

This repository is meant to help with adding Anomaly support to OpenXRay ([#1373 Support for Anomaly](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues/1373)) by making it easy to extract all the meaningful code changes made to the xray-monolith engine while ignoring pretty much all whitespace, line and/or formatting changes.
